During the first semester of our first year, we developed a staircase in a group of three. Our idea was to create an endless staircase, that represented the idea of a ‘staircase to heaven’. We aimed to achieve this by putting a concrete block in the middle, with at each corner a platform that connects the stairs with each other. The block in the middle ensures that the entrants wont see each other while walking on the stairs, which contributes to the idea of a mysterious staircase to heaven.
