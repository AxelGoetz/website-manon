During this casestudy, an existing project, a townhouse in Niel (a small Belgian town), was imposed on us. The house was still under construction and had to be built and further designed for a family of three, namely a couple and their child. Several things had to be taken into account, such as the fact that the child was only a few months old, and that the dad was working in shifts. These factors had to be taken carefully into
consideration during the design of the house. This is why, I made sure that every family member has their own level in the house, where they could retire in peace and where a good acoustic is guaranteed. The vertical circulation prevails in the plan, mainly because of the splitlevels, who divide the house into different rooms because of the differences in height. In addition, they also create a feeling of space and openness.
