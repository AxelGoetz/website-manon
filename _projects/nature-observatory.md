A nature look-out center, created in an abandoned warehouse and to be placed somewhere of choice. As my concept was to ‘admire the light’, I chose to place my center on The Lofoten Islands in Norway. As this is one of the most beautiful places to admire natural lighting. I designed four different areas, each representing a different season of the year. Each area consists of a different lighting, peculiar to the season, which is obtained by several heights of floorings and different kinds of canvases..
