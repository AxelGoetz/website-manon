The pavilion, situated at the park of Middelheim, exhibited two artworks. The statue “Unique Forms of Continuity in Space” from Umberto Boccioni and Victor Vasarely’s painting, were both to be placed carefully in the pavilion.
To guaranty that both works of art were treated with the necessary respect, research concerning the meaning of the works was needed. In his statue, Umberto Boccioni aimed to represent movement and speed, by a figure that prepares himself to run straight ahead. To emphasize this movement, I placed straight walls on both sides. This strengthens the straight line of the running statue, that seems to be running towards the outside of the pavilion.
The second work of art, Vasarely’s painting, Laute II, is an example of an optical illusion. This is why I opted for a clean white background, to leave the bright colors full justice to.
