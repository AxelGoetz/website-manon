For this project, I wanted to create a personal space, in which you can communicate and observe. My thoughts immediately went out to a watchtower, used by foresters and other nature lovers to observe as well as communicate with the fauna and  aura. My personal space was therefore an area where you can both enjoy and observe nature on your own. But where you can also withdraw yourself to the inside of the personal space, to rather focus on communication. It is therefore a tool that is multifunctional, very easy to use and easily movable from place to place.
