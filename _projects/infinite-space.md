When first confronted with the idea of an “infinite space”, I found it rather vague. However, it became a very interesting concept to explore. In this space, we where asked to design a living area for a couple. In a next design phase, each student got given a different concept, that had to be represented in the design.

My design represents the term ‘strong’. I tried to incorporate this concept by working with one big function block, which I have taken apart to create different rooms that the couple potentially need. Even though the block has been taken apart to provide several functions, it still represents one strong whole. It is divided in two main sections, a more private one and a slightly more
public one. On the left the more public spaces are located, such as the kitchen and the living space, on the right you can find the bath and
bedroom.
